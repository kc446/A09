	since there needs to be an index page in order for it to work i just recreated the page from the last assignment and removed all the files in the provided resource folder that weren't related to this assignment because it had....way too many resources for something we only need the one page for
	tryin to keep things clean and organized, y'know???
	i did leave some of the Icon_ files though because i thought they were necessary for it to work on Mac computers. i wouldn't know because i use windows-->
